## 🚀 Overview

This repository provides the **base development container** configuration used across engineering projects. It is designed to be:

- ✅ **Cross-platform**: macOS and Windows (WSL2) compatible using VS Code or Cursor
- 🧱 **Reusable**: drop into any repo to enable consistent local dev experience
- 🔐 **Secure and configurable**: injects secrets via environment, not committed
- 🧩 **Smart defaults**: tools, AWS profiles, aliases, Python setup, Git config, and more
- 🧪 **Consistent environments**: ensures identical local dev setups across teams using `asdf` to pin and manage exact binary versions
- 🚀 **CI/CD ready**: supports automated environments with `CICD=true` flag
- 📝 **Windows line ending support**: automatically converts CRLF to LF on WSL for compatibility

📦 Repo URL: [`https://github.com/matthew-dresden/agentic-workspace`](https://github.com/matthew-dresden/agentic-workspace)

---

## 🧰 What's Included

- `devcontainer.json` — VS Code container definition
- `.devcontainer.postcreate.sh` — container setup script
- `project-setup.sh` — project-specific setup script for custom initialization
- `fix-line-endings.py` — automatic Windows line ending conversion for WSL compatibility
- `workspace` — Agentic Workspace CLI tool for environment management
- Git, AWS CLI, Docker, Python, `asdf`, aliases, shell profile injection
- Extension support for Claude Code, AWS Toolkit, and developer productivity tools

---

## 💡 Built-In Tooling

The [default catalog entry](catalog/default/devcontainer.json) installs:

- ✅ Claude Code extension (AI coding assistant, VS Code/Cursor compatible)
- ✅ AWS Toolkit (CloudFormation, resource management, SSO integration)
- ✅ GitLens, YAML, Python, Docker, Makefile Tools
- ✅ Jinja, spell checking, ESLint, Angular

These extensions are auto-installed on container start and work with both VS Code and Cursor. You can create [custom catalog entries](docs/CATALOG_CREATION.md) with different extensions and settings tailored to your team or project.

> ℹ️ **GitHub Copilot is disabled by default** in the default catalog entry. The configuration sets `github.copilot.enable: false` and `chat.extensionUnification.enabled: false` to prevent Copilot from activating. If you prefer to use Claude instead of Copilot and want to fully remove Copilot from VS Code, see [Optional: Removing GitHub Copilot](#optional-removing-github-copilot) for host-level steps.

> To skip Claude Code CLI installation in the devcontainer, set `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLED` to `false` in your developer profile. The Claude Code VS Code extension remains available but the CLI binary will not be installed. This applies to the default catalog — other catalogs may handle this differently.

---

## 🖥 Prerequisites

### For macOS
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) or [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/)
- [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) — optional
- Python 3.12.9 - [Installation Guide](supplemental-docs/PYTHON_INSTALL.md#for-macos-using-asdf)

### For Windows
- [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
- [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) or [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/)
- Python 3.12.9 - [Installation Guide](supplemental-docs/PYTHON_INSTALL.md#for-windows-using-windows-store-or-official-installer)

> ⚠️ **Important for Windows users**: When cloning Git repositories that will use this devcontainer, ensure Git is configured to use Unix line endings (LF) instead of Windows line endings (CRLF). Configure this globally with:
> ```bash
> git config --global core.autocrlf false
> git config --global core.eol lf
> ```
>
> This prevents issues with shell scripts and other text files when running in WSL environments. The devcontainer includes automatic line ending conversion for WSL compatibility.

### VS Code / Cursor Host Settings (Proxy Users Only)

> **This section only applies when using a corporate proxy (`HOST_PROXY=true`).** If you are not behind a proxy, leave auto port forwarding enabled — it is needed for OAuth callbacks, webhook testing, and other development workflows.

If using a proxy, configure these **host-level** settings before opening any devcontainer. Without this, VS Code will forward ports used by the proxy and other internal services, causing conflicts.

1. Open Settings (Cmd/Ctrl + ,)
2. Search for "Remote" or navigate to **Features > Remote**
3. Configure these settings:
   - **Auto Forward Ports** — uncheck (disable)
   - **Auto Forward Ports Source** — set to `hybrid`
   - **Forward Ports On Open** — uncheck (disable)
   - **Restore Forwarded Ports** — uncheck (disable)

These settings persist across sessions and only need to be configured once. See [Disabling VS Code Auto Port Forwarding](#-disabling-vs-code-auto-port-forwarding) for details.

### Optional: Removing GitHub Copilot

> This section only applies if you are using Claude instead of Copilot and wish to remove Copilot from VS Code. Copilot is already disabled inside the devcontainer via configuration defaults — these steps remove it from the host IDE as well.

1. Open Settings (Cmd/Ctrl + ,) → search for "Remote" → navigate to **Features > Remote**
   - **Default Extensions If Installed Locally** — remove `GitHub.copilot` and `GitHub.copilot-chat` from the list (keep `GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github` if desired). These extensions are auto-installed in remote environments when present locally, which causes unwanted Copilot prompts inside devcontainers.
2. **Disable built-in Copilot extensions** (VS Code 1.96+ bundles Copilot as a built-in extension):
   - Open Extensions sidebar → type `@builtin copilot` in the search bar
   - Disable both **GitHub Copilot** and **GitHub Copilot Chat**
   - This removes the "Finish setup" prompt and Copilot chat panel from VS Code
3. **Disable Copilot extension unification:**
   - Search for `chat.extensionUnification.enabled` in Settings
   - Uncheck **Chat › Extension Unification: Enabled**
   - This prevents VS Code from merging all Copilot functionality into the chat extension

### IDE Command Line Setup

The `workspace` CLI requires IDE command-line tools to launch projects. Enable them as follows:

#### VS Code CLI Setup
1. Open **VS Code**
2. Press `⌘ + Shift + P` (macOS) or `Ctrl + Shift + P` (Windows/Linux)
3. Type: **Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH**
4. Run the command and restart your terminal
5. Test: `code .`

#### Cursor CLI Setup
1. Open **Cursor**
2. Press `⌘ + Shift + P` (macOS) or `Ctrl + Shift + P` (Windows/Linux)
3. Type: **Shell Command: Install 'cursor' command in PATH**
4. Run the command and restart your terminal
5. Test: `cursor .`

---

## 🪄 Quick Start

### 1. Install the CLI Tool

First, install the Agentic Workspace CLI using pipx (recommended to avoid package conflicts):

```bash
pipx install agentic-workspace
```

You can also install a specific version:

```bash
pipx install agentic-workspace==0.1.0
```

To install directly from GitHub (alternative method):

```bash
pipx install git+https://github.com/matthew-dresden/agentic-workspace.git@0.1.0#subdirectory=workspace-cli
```

If you don't have pipx installed, install it first:
```bash
python -m pip install pipx
```

After installation, you can run the CLI from anywhere:

```bash
workspace --help
```

### 2. Set Up Your Project

You can set up a devcontainer in your project using the CLI:

```bash
workspace setup-devcontainer /path/to/your/project
```

This will:
1. Clone the devcontainer catalog and copy configuration files to your project
2. Guide you through an interactive setup process
3. Let you select or create a template for your environment
4. Configure AWS profiles if needed

If your organization provides a specialized catalog, set the environment variable:

```bash
export WORKSPACE_CATALOG_URL="https://github.com/your-org/devcontainer-catalog.git"
workspace setup-devcontainer /path/to/your/project
```

You can also select a specific entry directly (useful for CI/automation):

```bash
export WORKSPACE_CATALOG_URL="https://github.com/your-org/devcontainer-catalog.git"
workspace setup-devcontainer --catalog-entry java-backend /path/to/your/project
```



> 💡 **Pro tip**: Consider committing the `.devcontainer` directory to your repository (excluding sensitive files) to speed up environment setup for your team. See the [Git Hygiene](#-git-hygiene) section for details.

---

### 3. Customize Your Developer Environment

When running `workspace setup-devcontainer`, you'll be guided through configuring:

- AWS configuration (enabled by default)
- Git branch and credentials
- Git authentication method (token or SSH)
- Developer information
- Host proxy configuration
- Extra Ubuntu packages
- Pager selection (cat, less, more, most)
- AWS CLI output format (json, table, text, yaml) - only if AWS is enabled
- Custom environment variables

The interactive setup will create a `devcontainer-environment-variables.json` file with your settings.

The `devcontainer-environment-variables.json` file supports these values (inside `containerEnv`):
- `AWS_CONFIG_ENABLED` (default: `true`) - Set to `false` to disable AWS configuration
- `AWS_DEFAULT_OUTPUT` (default: `json`) - Choose from: json, table, text, yaml (only when AWS enabled)
- `DEFAULT_GIT_BRANCH` (e.g. `main`)
- `DEVELOPER_NAME` - Your name, used in the devcontainer
- `EXTRA_APT_PACKAGES` - Space-separated list of extra Ubuntu packages to install
- `GIT_AUTH_METHOD` (default: `token`) - Choose from: token, ssh. When set to `ssh`, Git is configured to rewrite HTTPS URLs to SSH, enabling tools that use HTTPS Git URLs to authenticate via your SSH key. When set to `token`, Git is configured to rewrite SSH URLs to HTTPS, enabling tools that use SSH Git URLs to authenticate via your token.
- `GIT_PROVIDER_URL` (default: `github.com`) - Git provider hostname (no protocol prefix)
- `GIT_TOKEN` - Personal access token (only when `GIT_AUTH_METHOD=token`)
- `GIT_USER` - Git username
- `GIT_USER_EMAIL` - Git email for commits
- `HOST_PROXY` (default: `false`) - Set to `true` to enable host proxy support
- `HOST_PROXY_URL` - Proxy URL (only when `HOST_PROXY=true`, e.g. `http://host.docker.internal:3128`)
- `PAGER` (default: `cat`) - Choose from: cat, less, more, most

In addition to the built-in variables above, the template creation flow supports **custom environment variables**. You can add any number of free-form key-value pairs — useful for API tokens, AI agent credentials, feature flags, or any project-specific configuration your devcontainer needs. Custom variables are injected into `containerEnv` alongside the built-in ones and are available inside the container at runtime.

#### Client/Project Templates

The `setup-devcontainer` command will ask if you want to:
- Use an existing template
- Create a new reusable template
- Create a one-time configuration

Templates are saved in `~/.workspace-templates/` and can be reused across projects.

You can also manage templates directly:

```bash
# Create a new template interactively
workspace template create client1

# Edit an existing template interactively (recommended over manual file editing)
workspace template edit client1

# Save current environment as a template
workspace template save client1

# View a template's configuration values
workspace template view client1

# List available templates
workspace template list

# Load a template into a new project
cd /path/to/new-project
workspace template load client1

# Delete one or more templates
workspace template delete template1 template2

# Upgrade a template to the current CLI version
workspace template upgrade my-template
```

> **Recommended**: Use `workspace template edit` to modify templates instead of editing JSON files manually. The interactive editor handles SSH key validation, auth method switching, and environment variable constraints correctly. Manual editing can introduce issues, especially with SSH-based Git authentication where the SSH private key content must be validated.

When loading a template:
1. The CLI copies the template from `~/.workspace-templates/client1.json`
2. It creates a new `devcontainer-environment-variables.json` file in your project
3. This file contains all the environment settings from the template (Git credentials, AWS settings, etc.)
4. You can then run `workspace code` to use these settings with your project

This allows you to maintain consistent configurations across multiple projects for the same client.

#### Template Version Compatibility

Templates are saved with version information that tracks which CLI version created them. When loading a template created with an older version of the CLI, the tool automatically detects version mismatches and provides options:

- **Upgrade the template**: Updates the template to the current CLI format while preserving settings
- **Create a new template**: Starts fresh with the current CLI version
- **Use anyway**: Attempts to use the template as-is (may cause issues)
- **Exit**: Cancels the operation without making changes

This version checking ensures templates remain compatible as the CLI evolves.

#### Template Upgrade

The `template upgrade` command validates and updates a template to the current CLI version. It detects missing keys, invalid values, and auth inconsistencies, then prompts you to fix them interactively:

```bash
workspace template upgrade my-template
```

#### Missing Variable Detection

When running `workspace code <path>`, the CLI validates environment variables against both the base configuration and the developer template. If missing variables are detected:

- A warning displays the missing variables with their expected values
- You are prompted to choose an action:
  1. **Update devcontainer configuration and add missing variables** — adds variables and replaces `.devcontainer/` files from the catalog
  2. **Only add the missing variables to existing files** — adds variables without touching `.devcontainer/`
  3. **Open without changes** — launches the IDE as-is (may cause issues)

This ensures your development environment stays up-to-date with the latest requirements.

---

### 4. Configure AWS Profile Map (Optional)

By default, AWS configuration is enabled. If you don't need AWS access, you can disable it during the interactive setup or by setting `AWS_CONFIG_ENABLED=false` in your `devcontainer-environment-variables.json`.

When using the interactive setup with AWS enabled, you'll be presented with two options for providing your AWS profile configuration:

#### Option 1: JSON Format (Complete Configuration)
Paste your complete AWS profile configuration in JSON format:

```json
{
  "default": {
    "region": "us-west-2",
    "sso_start_url": "https://example.awsapps.com/start",
    "sso_region": "us-west-2",
    "account_name": "example-dev-account",
    "account_id": "123456789012",
    "role_name": "DeveloperAccess"
  }
}
```

#### Option 2: Standard Format (Profile by Profile)
Enter AWS profiles one at a time in standard AWS config format:

```ini
[default]
sso_start_url       = https://example.awsapps.com/start
sso_region          = us-west-2
sso_account_name    = example-dev-account
sso_account_id      = 123456789012
sso_role_name       = DeveloperAccess
region              = us-west-2
```

The setup will:
- Validate each profile for required fields
- Prompt you to re-enter if validation fails
- Ask if you want to add additional profiles
- Automatically convert to the expected JSON format

#### Manual Configuration
Create `.devcontainer/aws-profile-map.json` and define your AWS SSO accounts using the JSON format shown above.

> ⚠️ This file is required only when AWS configuration is enabled (`AWS_CONFIG_ENABLED=true`).

---

### 5. Setting Up Your Environment

```bash
# Launch VS Code for the current project (default IDE)
workspace code

# Launch Cursor for the current project
workspace code --ide cursor

# Launch VS Code for a specific project
workspace code /path/to/your-project

# Launch Cursor for a specific project
workspace code /path/to/your-project --ide cursor
```

This will:
- Validate your `devcontainer-environment-variables.json` and `shell.env` files
- Detect and prompt to resolve any missing environment variables
- Launch your IDE (VS Code or Cursor)
- Display a confirmation message

> ⚠️ **Note**: After VS Code launches, you'll need to accept the prompt to reopen in container.

> 💡 **Pro tip for multiple projects**: Use a dedicated terminal for each project:
> ```bash
> # In terminal 1 (for project A)
> workspace code /path/to/project-a
>
> # In terminal 2 (for project B)
> workspace code /path/to/project-b
> ```
>
> This approach prevents environment variable conflicts when working with multiple projects simultaneously.

> 🚀 **Advanced tip**: You can launch any supported IDE for another project directly from within a running devcontainer:
> ```bash
> # From within any devcontainer terminal
> workspace code /path/to/another-project
> workspace code /path/to/another-project --ide cursor
> ```
>
> This will open a new IDE window with the other project's devcontainer, allowing you to work on multiple projects simultaneously.

---

## 🚀 CI/CD Support

The devcontainer supports running in CI/CD environments where developer-specific configurations (Git credentials, AWS profiles, developer names) are not needed or are handled separately.

To enable CI/CD mode, set the `CICD` environment variable to `true`:

```bash
export CICD=true
```

When `CICD=true`, the devcontainer will skip:
- AWS configuration validation and setup
- Git credential configuration
- Developer name environment variable setup
- AWS profile creation

This allows the devcontainer to run in automated environments where:
- Git authentication is handled by the CI/CD system
- AWS credentials are provided through IAM roles or other mechanisms
- Developer-specific personalization is not required

### Required Environment Variables for CI/CD

When running in CI/CD mode, you still need to set these core environment variables:

```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
env:
  CICD: "true"                           # Enable CI/CD mode
  DEFAULT_GIT_BRANCH: "main"              # Required: Git branch for aliases
  EXTRA_APT_PACKAGES: ""                  # Optional: Additional Ubuntu packages
  PAGER: "cat"                            # Optional: Pager for command output (defaults to cat)
  AWS_DEFAULT_OUTPUT: "json"              # Optional: AWS CLI output format (defaults to json)
```

### Environment Variables Skipped in CI/CD Mode

These variables are not needed when `CICD=true` as they're handled by the CI/CD system:

```yaml
# These are SKIPPED in CI/CD mode - do not set them
# AWS_CONFIG_ENABLED: "true"             # Skipped: AWS handled by CI/CD
# DEVELOPER_NAME: "johndoe"              # Skipped: Not needed in CI/CD
# GIT_PROVIDER_URL: "github.com"         # Skipped: Git handled by CI/CD
# GIT_TOKEN: "<token>"                   # Skipped: Git handled by CI/CD
# GIT_USER: "john.doe"                   # Skipped: Git handled by CI/CD
# GIT_USER_EMAIL: "john.doe@example.com" # Skipped: Git handled by CI/CD
```

## 🧩 Post-Launch Setup

### 🤖 Claude Code

- Auto-installed as the `anthropic.claude-code` extension
- The login prompt is suppressed by default (`claude-code.disableLoginPrompt: true`)
- To use: open the Claude Code sidebar or run `claude` from the integrated terminal
- Authenticate via the terminal by running `claude` and following the browser login flow

### 🧰 AWS Toolkit

- Auto-installed as the `amazonwebservices.aws-toolkit-vscode` extension
- Provides CloudFormation linting, resource management, and SSO integration
- AWS SSO prompts are suppressed by default — connect manually via the AWS sidebar or `aws sso login`

---

### 🔐 Connect to AWS via SSO

From the container:
```bash
aws sso login --profile your-profile-name
```

- Omitting `--profile` uses the `"default"` profile from your `~/.aws/config`.

---

### ✅ Confirm Git Auth

```bash
git config --get user.email
git config --get user.name
git ls-remote https://github.com/your-org/your-repo.git
```

Or open the Source Control tab in your IDE to confirm the repo is accessible.

If using SSH authentication (`GIT_AUTH_METHOD=ssh`), the devcontainer automatically configures Git to rewrite HTTPS URLs to SSH. Verify the rewrite is active:

```bash
git config --global --get url."git@github.com:".insteadOf
# Expected: https://github.com/
```

If using token authentication (`GIT_AUTH_METHOD=token`), the devcontainer automatically configures Git to rewrite SSH URLs to HTTPS. Verify the rewrite is active:

```bash
git config --global --get url."https://github.com/".insteadOf
# Expected: git@github.com:
```

---

## 🔧 Project-Specific Setup

The devcontainer includes a **project-specific setup script** that runs automatically after the main devcontainer setup is complete. This allows you to add project-specific initialization commands without modifying the core devcontainer files.

### 📝 Setup Script Location

The project setup script is located at:
```
.devcontainer/project-setup.sh
```

### 🚀 What to Add

Add any commands needed to make your project immediately ready for development:

```bash
# Example project-specific setup commands
if [ -f "Makefile" ]; then
  log_info "Running make configure..."
  make configure
fi

if [ -f "requirements.txt" ]; then
  log_info "Installing Python dependencies..."
  pip install -r requirements.txt
fi

if [ -f "package.json" ]; then
  log_info "Installing Node.js dependencies..."
  npm install
fi

if [ -f "docker-compose.yml" ]; then
  log_info "Starting Docker services..."
  docker-compose up -d
fi
```

### 🌐 Environment Variables

The project setup script has access to:
- All environment variables from `shell.env`
- All environment variables from `devcontainer.json`
- Logging functions: `log_info`, `log_success`, `log_warn`, `log_error`

### 🎨 IDE Customizations

Projects can also customize IDE settings and extensions by modifying the `customizations` section in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`:

```json
{
  "customizations": {
    "vscode": {
      "extensions": [
        "ms-python.python",
        "ms-toolsai.jupyter",
        "your-project-specific-extension"
      ],
      "settings": {
        "python.defaultInterpreterPath": "/usr/local/python/current/bin/python3",
        "editor.tabSize": 2,
        "files.exclude": {
          "**/.git": true,
          "**/node_modules": true
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This works for all supported IDEs including VS Code, Cursor, and others that support devcontainer customizations.

### ⚠️ Important Notes

- **DO NOT modify** these catalog-managed files — they are replaced on every catalog update:
  - `.devcontainer/.devcontainer.postcreate.sh` — main postcreate hook
  - `.devcontainer/postcreate-wrapper.sh` — postcreate orchestration
  - `.devcontainer/devcontainer-functions.sh` — shared shell functions
  - `.devcontainer/fix-line-endings.py` — Windows line ending conversion
  - The `postCreateCommand` field in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`
  - The `image` field in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` — the base image is pinned by the catalog so every project resolves the same runtime. Only change this if you are hosting an equivalent image yourself.
- **DO modify** `.devcontainer/project-setup.sh` for your project needs
- **DO add** custom scripts to `.devcontainer/` — the project-setup script can call any number of additional scripts you place there
- **DO customize** `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` for IDE settings, extensions, and features (but not `postCreateCommand` or `image`)
- This approach ensures you can receive devcontainer updates without conflicts

#### Execution Context

The main postcreate script (`.devcontainer.postcreate.sh`) runs as **root**. It configures shell profiles, installs tools, sets up Git and AWS, then fixes ownership with `chown -R vscode:vscode /home/vscode`.

The project-setup script (`project-setup.sh`) runs **after** the main postcreate as the **container user** (`vscode`) — not root. This means files created by project-setup are already owned by the correct user and no chown cleanup is needed. The script sources `devcontainer-functions.sh` so logging functions (`log_info`, `log_success`, `log_warn`, `log_error`) are available. Note that shell profiles (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`) are configured for future shell sessions, so paths and environment may differ from your interactive terminal.

### 📝 Example Use Cases

- **Python projects**: Install dependencies, set up virtual environments
- **Node.js projects**: Run `npm install`, build assets
- **Docker projects**: Start required services with `docker-compose`
- **Database projects**: Initialize databases, run migrations
- **Configuration**: Generate config files, set up symlinks
- **Build tools**: Run `make configure`, `cmake`, or other build setup

---

## 🐍 Primary Runtime Installation

Primary runtimes (Python, Node.js, Java, etc.) should be installed via devcontainer **features** in `devcontainer.json`, not via `asdf` and `.tool-versions`. VS Code and Cursor need to discover the primary runtime before `asdf` runs during the postcreate phase — installing runtimes through features ensures the IDE can detect and configure language support (IntelliSense, debugging, linting) on first launch.

```json
{
  "features": {
    "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/python:1": {
      "version": "3.14"
    }
  }
}
```

The `.tool-versions` file is used for pinning **supplementary tools** via `asdf` (e.g., `jq`, `pre-commit`, `terraform`) — tools that the IDE does not need to know about at startup.

> ✅ **Automatic .tool-versions creation**: The setup command automatically creates an empty `.tool-versions` file in your project root if one does not exist. Add tool entries as needed for your project.

---

## 🔄 Rebuilding the Devcontainer

When you make changes to the devcontainer configuration (such as modifying `devcontainer.json`, `devcontainer-environment-variables.json`, or `.tool-versions`), you'll need to rebuild the container for changes to take effect:

1. A popup will typically appear in your IDE prompting you to rebuild when configuration files change
2. Alternatively, you can manually rebuild by:
   - Opening the Command Palette (Command+Shift+P or Ctrl+Shift+P)
   - Typing "Dev Containers: Rebuild Container" and selecting it

> ⚠️ **Important**: Always rebuild the container after changing any devcontainer configuration files to ensure your changes are applied.

---

## 🐳 Docker-in-Docker Support

The devcontainer supports **nested Docker** with `docker-in-docker`.

To enable Docker Swarm inside the container:
```bash
docker swarm init
```

> You can now run full containerized workflows inside the devcontainer itself.

---

## 🔌 Disabling VS Code Auto Port Forwarding

> **This section only applies when using a corporate proxy (`HOST_PROXY=true`).** If you are not behind a proxy, leave auto port forwarding enabled — it is needed for OAuth callbacks, webhook testing, and other development workflows that rely on port forwarding.

VS Code automatically detects and forwards ports from processes running inside the devcontainer to the host. This includes any listening socket found by VS Code's port scanning. In proxy environments, this causes port conflicts with the host-side proxy (e.g., tinyproxy for corporate proxy support).

The `devcontainer.json` includes settings to disable this behavior inside the container (`remote.autoForwardPorts: false`, `remote.autoForwardPortsSource: "process"`, and `remote.otherPortsAttributes.onAutoForward: "ignore"`). However, VS Code also has **host-level settings** that must be configured before opening any Remote or Dev Container connection.

**Required VS Code Host Settings for Proxy Users** (set these on your local machine before connecting):

1. Open VS Code Settings (Cmd/Ctrl + ,)
2. Search for "Remote" or navigate to **Features > Remote**
3. Disable/configure these settings:
   - **Auto Forward Ports** — uncheck (disable)
   - **Auto Forward Ports Source** — set to `hybrid`
   - **Forward Ports On Open** — uncheck (disable)
   - **Restore Forwarded Ports** — uncheck (disable)

These settings persist across VS Code sessions and only need to be configured once.

## 🧩 JetBrains Compatibility

JetBrains IDEs (like PyCharm) support Devcontainers via [JetBrains Gateway](https://www.jetbrains.com/remote-development/gateway/), but:

- Post-create hooks, VS Code extensions, and shell customization are **not** guaranteed
- VS Code or Cursor are **strongly recommended** for full compatibility

## 📁 File Reference

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` | VS Code container setup |
| `.devcontainer/.devcontainer.postcreate.sh` | Container provisioning logic |
| `.devcontainer/project-setup.sh` | Project-specific setup commands |
| `.devcontainer/fix-line-endings.py` | Windows line ending conversion for WSL compatibility |
| `.devcontainer/aws-profile-map.json` | Your active AWS profiles |

## 🧪 Validate Your Config

### Catalog Validation

The CLI includes a comprehensive catalog validation command that checks structural integrity, content correctness, and consistency across the entire catalog:

```bash
# Validate the default catalog (remote)
workspace catalog validate

# Validate a local catalog directory
workspace catalog validate --local /path/to/catalog

# Validate using the Makefile target (installs CLI from this repo first)
make validate-catalog
```

The `catalog validate` command checks:

| Area | Check |
|------|-------|
| Common assets | Required files present (`postcreate`, `functions`, `wrapper`, `project-setup`) |
| Common assets | Subdirectories exist (`nix-family-os/`, `wsl-family-os/`) with required files |
| Common assets | Shell scripts have executable permission |
| Common assets | All `.json` files in `root-project-assets/` are valid JSON |
| Per-entry | Required files present (`catalog-entry.json`, `devcontainer.json`, `VERSION`) |
| Per-entry | `VERSION` contains valid semver (X.Y.Z) |
| Per-entry | `devcontainer.json` has `name` field and at least one container source (`image`/`build`/`dockerFile`/`dockerComposeFile`) |
| Per-entry | `postCreateCommand` references postcreate scripts |
| Per-entry | Directory name matches `catalog-entry.json` `name` field |
| Per-entry | No file conflicts with common assets (including subdirectories) |
| Per-entry | `catalog-entry.json` has valid name pattern, description, tags, and no unknown fields |
| Cross-entry | No duplicate entry names |

### JSON Validation

To validate your `devcontainer-environment-variables.json` file is valid JSON:

```bash
python3 -c "import json; json.load(open('devcontainer-environment-variables.json'))" && echo "Valid JSON"
```

If the JSON is malformed, Python will report a parse error with the line and column number.

## 🧼 Git Hygiene

- ❌ Never commit `shell.env`, `devcontainer-environment-variables.json`, or `.devcontainer/ssh-private-key`
- ✅ Use `.tool-versions` to ensure reproducibility
- ✅ Use `aws-profile-map.json` to declare AWS SSO profiles
- `.gitignore` excludes common temp files, IDE config, and secrets

> 💡 **Pro tip**: You can commit the `.devcontainer` directory to your repository for faster team onboarding. Add these lines to your `.gitignore`:
> ```
> # Devcontainer - commit structure but not secrets
> devcontainer-environment-variables.json
> .devcontainer/aws-profile-map.json
> .devcontainer/ssh-private-key
> shell.env
> ```
>
> This approach lets you version control the devcontainer configuration while excluding sensitive information.

## 🛠️ CLI Reference

The Agentic Workspace CLI provides several commands to manage your devcontainer environment:

```bash
# Show help
workspace --help

# Set up a devcontainer in a project directory
workspace setup-devcontainer /path/to/your/project

# Set up using a specific entry from a specialized catalog
export WORKSPACE_CATALOG_URL="https://github.com/your-org/catalog.git"
workspace setup-devcontainer --catalog-entry java-backend /path/to/your/project

# Launch IDE with the devcontainer environment (default: VS Code)
workspace code [/path/to/your/project]

# Launch specific IDE
workspace code --ide cursor [/path/to/your/project]
workspace code --ide vscode [/path/to/your/project]

# Launch IDE for another project (works from within any devcontainer)
workspace code /path/to/another-project --ide cursor

# Manage templates
workspace template list
workspace template view my-template
workspace template edit my-template
workspace template create my-template
workspace template save my-template
workspace template load my-template
workspace template delete template1 template2
workspace template upgrade my-template
```

### CLI Environment Variables

The CLI reads the following environment variables. Run `workspace <command> --help` to see which variables apply to each command.

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `WORKSPACE_CATALOG_URL` | Override the default catalog repository URL (supports `@tag` suffix). Used by `setup-devcontainer` and `catalog` commands. |
| `WORKSPACE_SKIP_UPDATE` | Set to `1` to disable automatic update checks. |
| `WORKSPACE_DEBUG_UPDATE` | Set to `1` to enable debug logging for update checks. |

### Shell Completion

Enable tab completion for all commands, subcommands, and flags. Completions stay in sync automatically after `pipx upgrade`.

```bash
# Bash — add to ~/.bashrc
eval "$(workspace completion bash)"

# Zsh — add to ~/.zshrc
eval "$(workspace completion zsh)"
```

See the [Shell Completion Guide](workspace-cli/docs/SHELL_COMPLETION.md) for static file installation, prerequisites, and troubleshooting.

For detailed information about the Agentic Workspace CLI, see the [CLI documentation](workspace-cli/README.md).

## DevContainer Catalogs

This repository serves as the **default catalog** for the Agentic Workspace CLI. A catalog is a Git repository containing one or more entries — each entry is a complete devcontainer configuration that can be applied to a project.

Organizations can create their own specialized catalogs with custom entries, shared assets, and team-specific tooling. The CLI discovers and applies entries from any catalog repository.

### Key Concepts

- **Catalog** — A Git repository with `common/devcontainer-assets/` (shared files), `common/root-project-assets/` (root-level project files), and `catalog/` (one or more entries)
- **Entry** — A directory under `catalog/` containing `catalog-entry.json`, `devcontainer.json`, and `VERSION`
- **Common assets** — Files and directories in `common/devcontainer-assets/` that are **automatically copied into every project's `.devcontainer/`** when an entry is installed. This includes shared scripts (postcreate, functions, project-setup) and host-side proxy toolkits (`nix-family-os/`, `wsl-family-os/`). Any file or directory added to `common/devcontainer-assets/` is distributed to all projects regardless of which entry is selected.
- **Root project assets** — Files and directories in `common/root-project-assets/` that are **automatically copied into the project root** (not `.devcontainer/`) when an entry is installed. This is used for standardized root-level files such as `CLAUDE.md` (AI coding standards) and `.claude/` (Claude Code configuration). This directory is optional — catalogs without it still work normally.

### Catalog Commands

```bash
# List entries from a catalog
WORKSPACE_CATALOG_URL="https://github.com/your-org/your-catalog.git" \
  workspace catalog list

# Filter by tags
workspace catalog list --tags java,backend

# Validate a catalog (remote)
workspace catalog validate

# Validate a catalog (local clone)
workspace catalog validate --local /path/to/catalog
```

### Catalog Repository Structure

```
catalog-repo/
  common/
    devcontainer-assets/
      .devcontainer.postcreate.sh      # Shared postcreate hook (required)
      devcontainer-functions.sh         # Shared shell functions (required)
      postcreate-wrapper.sh            # Postcreate wrapper script (required)
      project-setup.sh                 # Project-setup template (required)
      nix-family-os/                   # Host proxy toolkit for macOS/Linux
      wsl-family-os/                   # Host proxy toolkit for Windows/WSL
    root-project-assets/               # Root-level project files (optional)
      CLAUDE.md                        # AI coding standards
      .claude/                         # Claude Code configuration directory
        settings.json                  # Claude Code project settings (empty default)
  catalog/
    <entry-name>/
      catalog-entry.json               # Entry metadata (required)
      devcontainer.json                # DevContainer config (required)
      VERSION                          # Semver version (required)
```

Everything in `common/devcontainer-assets/` is automatically copied into every project's `.devcontainer/` directory — this is how shared scripts and proxy toolkits are distributed to all projects. Entry-specific files are copied first, then common assets are overlaid (common assets take precedence on name collisions).

Everything in `common/root-project-assets/` is automatically copied into the **project root** directory — this distributes standardized root-level files (such as `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/` configuration) to all projects when an entry is installed.

### Creating a Custom Catalog

See the [Catalog Creation Guide](docs/CATALOG_CREATION.md) for the full guide covering:

- Catalog repo structure and required files
- Step-by-step instructions for creating a new catalog
- Adding and validating catalog entries
- Tagging, releases, and distribution
- The 3-layer customization model (catalog entries, developer templates, project-setup.sh)
- Distribution via `WORKSPACE_CATALOG_URL`

For a working example, see this repository — it serves as the default catalog.

## 🔒 Host Proxy Setup (Required for Proxied Networks)

Projects that route all container traffic through a host-side proxy require tinyproxy on the host for devcontainer network access. You **must** configure tinyproxy on your host machine before building a devcontainer.

Choose the guide for your operating system:

- **macOS / Linux**: [Host Proxy Setup Guide](.devcontainer/nix-family-os/README.md)
- **Windows / WSL**: [Host Proxy Setup Guide](.devcontainer/wsl-family-os/README.md)
