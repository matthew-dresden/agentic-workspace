# Contributing to Agentic Workspace CLI

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Agentic Workspace CLI! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing to this project.

## Development Setup

The recommended way to set up your development environment is to use the devcontainer itself:

1. Ensure you have the [prerequisites](../README.md#-prerequisites) installed:
   - VS Code (latest version)
   - Docker Desktop
   - Dev Containers extension for VS Code (latest version)

2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/matthew-dresden/agentic-workspace.git
   cd devcontainer
   ```

3. Set up git hooks to ensure code quality:
   ```bash
   make configure
   ```

   This will:
   - Install pre-commit using asdf (or pip if asdf is not available)
   - Set up git hooks that:
     - Prevent secrets from being committed (AWS credentials, private keys)
     - Automatically format code in the CLI subdirectory
     - Ensure tests and linting pass before pushing CLI changes

4. Launch VS Code with the devcontainer:
   ```bash
   # If you already have the CLI installed
   workspace code .

   # Or open VS Code manually and reopen in container when prompted
   code .
   ```

5. For CLI development, install the package in development mode:
   ```bash
   cd workspace-cli
   make install
   ```

For more detailed setup instructions, see the [Quick Start](../README.md#-quick-start) guide in the main README.

## Code Style and Quality

We use the following tools to maintain code quality:

- **Ruff**: For code formatting and linting (replaces black, isort, flake8)
- **yamllint**: For YAML validation and formatting

Before submitting a pull request, ensure your code passes all style checks:

```bash
make lint
```

If there are any issues, you can automatically fix most of them with:

```bash
make format
```

### Repository-Wide Quality Checks

From the repository root, you can run comprehensive quality checks:

```bash
# Run all pre-commit checks (includes YAML validation, security scanning, etc.)
make pre-commit-check

# Check GitHub workflow YAML files specifically
make github-workflow-yaml-lint

# Fix YAML formatting and validation issues
make yaml-fix
```

These checks run automatically in CI/CD and include trailing whitespace removal, debug statement detection, JSON/YAML validation, security scanning, and more.

## Commit Message Conventions

This project follows [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification for commit messages. This enables automatic semantic versioning and changelog generation.

### Commit Message Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Supported Commit Types

| Type | Description | Version Bump | Example |
|------|-------------|--------------|---------|
| `feat` | New feature | **Minor** (1.2.0 → 1.3.0) | `feat: add new command option` |
| `fix` | Bug fix | **Patch** (1.2.0 → 1.2.1) | `fix: resolve parsing error` |
| `perf` | Performance improvement | **Patch** (1.2.0 → 1.2.1) | `perf: optimize file processing` |
| `security` | Security fix | **Patch** (1.2.0 → 1.2.1) | `security: fix path traversal vulnerability` |
| `revert` | Revert previous change | **Patch** (1.2.0 → 1.2.1) | `revert: undo feature X implementation` |
| `build` | Build system changes | No bump | `build: update dependencies` |
| `chore` | Maintenance tasks | No bump | `chore: update documentation` |
| `ci` | CI/CD changes | No bump | `ci: add workflow caching` |
| `docs` | Documentation changes | No bump | `docs: update API examples` |
| `refactor` | Code refactoring | No bump | `refactor: simplify error handling` |
| `style` | Code style changes | No bump | `style: fix formatting` |
| `test` | Test changes | No bump | `test: add unit tests for parser` |

### Breaking Changes

Any commit with `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the footer will trigger a **Major** version bump (1.2.0 → 2.0.0), regardless of the commit type:

```
feat: change API interface

BREAKING CHANGE: The parse() function now returns a different data structure
```

### Examples

- `feat: add support for custom templates`
- `fix: handle missing configuration files gracefully`
- `perf: cache parsed templates for better performance`
- `docs: add troubleshooting section to README`
- `chore(deps): update semantic-release to v4.0.0`

## Testing

### Unit Tests

Unit tests are located in the `tests/unit` directory. They test individual components of the code in isolation.

To run unit tests:

```bash
make unit-test
```

### Functional Tests

Functional tests are located in the `tests/functional` directory. They test the CLI commands as they would be used by actual users.

To run functional tests:

```bash
make functional-test
```

To see a report of functional test coverage:

```bash
make functional-test-report
```

### Test Requirements

- **Unit Tests**: Must maintain at least 90% code coverage
- **Functional Tests**: Must test all CLI commands and common error scenarios
- All tests must pass before merging code

## Adding New Features

When adding new features:

1. Create unit tests for all new code
2. Create functional tests that test the feature from a user's perspective
3. Update documentation in the README.md file
4. Update help text in the CLI commands

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/my-change`
3. Implement your changes with appropriate tests
4. Ensure all tests pass and code meets style guidelines
5. Submit a pull request with a clear description of the changes

## Release Process

### Automated Release

The release pipeline is fully automated. When changes are merged to `main`, the CI pipeline validates the code, then determines whether a release is needed based on conventional commit types. Only commits that trigger a version bump (`feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `security`, `revert`, or `BREAKING CHANGE`) will produce a release. Commits with non-bumping types (`docs`, `chore`, `ci`, `refactor`, `style`, `test`, `build`) pass validation but skip the release step entirely.

When a release is triggered, the pipeline computes the next semantic version, generates the changelog, creates and merges a release PR, tags the release, and triggers the publish workflow. A human approval gate on the `qa-approval` environment ensures releases are intentional. Publishing to PyPI requires a separate approval on the `pypi` environment.

Before merging to `main`:

1. Ensure all tests pass (`make test`)
2. Perform the [manual tests](MANUAL_TESTING.md) to verify functionality
3. Use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) to control version bumps (see [Commit Message Conventions](#commit-message-conventions))

After merge, the pipeline automatically handles version bumping, changelog generation, tagging, and publishing to PyPI. If no version-bumping commits are detected, the release steps are skipped entirely.
